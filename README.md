# About Project:
The main objective of this project is to identify various facial emotions like happy,sad,angry,disgust,fear,neutral. We have used Keras and tensorflow libraries to train and test the model and predicted the model performance with the help of Accuracy.


Project execution steps are follows:

• Data Collection
• Training and visualizing the data
• Testing the data
• Evaluating model performance
• Download the 
• Live demo through webcam
